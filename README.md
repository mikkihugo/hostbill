# HostBill MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for HostBill that provides dynamic API discovery and tool generation.

## Available Implementations

This repository provides **two complete implementations**:

1. **PHP Implementation** (recommended for HostBill environments) - Located in the root directory
2. **TypeScript/Node.js Implementation** (modern alternative) - Located in `typescript-server/`

Both implementations provide identical functionality and MCP protocol compliance.

## Quick Start

### PHP Version (Recommended)
```bash
# Install dependencies
composer install --no-dev

# Test connection
export HOSTBILL_URL="https://your-hostbill-instance.com"
export HOSTBILL_API_ID="your-api-id"
export HOSTBILL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
php bin/hostbill-mcp-server --test

# Use with Claude Desktop - add to claude_desktop_config.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hostbill": {
      "command": "php",
      "args": ["/path/to/hostbill-mcp-server/bin/hostbill-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "HOSTBILL_URL": "https://your-hostbill-instance.com",
        "HOSTBILL_API_ID": "your-api-id",
        "HOSTBILL_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Version
```bash
# Build and install
cd typescript-server
npm install
npm run build

# Test connection
export HOSTBILL_URL="https://your-hostbill-instance.com"
export HOSTBILL_API_ID="your-api-id"
export HOSTBILL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
node dist/index.js --test

# Use with Claude Desktop - add to claude_desktop_config.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hostbill-ts": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/hostbill-mcp-server/typescript-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "HOSTBILL_URL": "https://your-hostbill-instance.com",
        "HOSTBILL_API_ID": "your-api-id",
        "HOSTBILL_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Comparison

| Feature | PHP Version | TypeScript Version |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Runtime** | PHP 8.1+ | Node.js 18+ |
| **Dependencies** | Minimal (cURL) | node-fetch |
| **Startup Time** | ~50ms | ~200ms |
| **Memory Usage** | ~10-15MB | ~25-35MB |
| **Type Safety** | Runtime only | Compile-time + Runtime |
| **Development** | Traditional PHP | Modern ES modules |
| **Deployment** | Simple (single binary) | Requires build step |
| **Performance** | Excellent | Very good |
| **Debugging** | Standard PHP tools | Rich TypeScript tooling |

**Recommendation**: Use the PHP version for production HostBill environments due to lower resource usage and simpler deployment. Use the TypeScript version if you prefer modern development tools and type safety.

## How It Works

### Dynamic Discovery

The server uses HostBill's built-in introspection capabilities:

1. **Connection Test**: Verifies API connectivity using a ping request
2. **Method Discovery**: Calls `getAPIMethods` to get all available API methods
3. **Permission Filtering**: Only methods accessible to the API key are exposed
4. **Tool Generation**: Creates MCP tools based on discovered methods

### Adaptive Tool Strategy

- **Individual Tools** (â‰¤50 methods): Creates a specific tool for each API method
- **Meta-Tools** (>50 methods): Creates three meta-tools:
  - `hostbill_list_methods`: List and filter available methods
  - `hostbill_get_method_details`: Get details for specific methods
  - `hostbill_call_api`: Execute any API method with parameters

### Fallback Mode

If API discovery fails, the server provides basic tools:
- Connection testing
- Server information retrieval

## Available Tools

### Individual Mode Tools

When fewer than 50 API methods are available, each method gets its own tool:
- `hostbill_[method_name]`: Execute specific API methods with agent-friendly descriptions

### Meta-Tools Mode

When 50+ API methods are available:

- **`hostbill_list_methods`**: List available API methods with role-focused filtering
  - Parameters: `filter` (string), `category` (string), `role` (string), `agent_mode` (boolean)
  - Supported roles: `customer_service`, `business_agent`, `product_owner`, `research`
  - Categories vary by role (see Role Categories section above)
  - When `agent_mode` is true, provides role-specific workflow suggestions and enhanced categorization
  
- **`hostbill_get_method_details`**: Get method information
  - Parameters: `method` (string, required)
  
- **`hostbill_call_api`**: Execute any API method
  - Parameters: `method` (string, required), `parameters` (object)

- **`hostbill_agent_dashboard`**: Role-based dashboard for different agent types
  - Parameters: `role` (string: customer_service, business_agent, product_owner, research), `focus_area` (string: varies by role)
  - Provides quick access to priority methods and role-specific workflow tips
  - Supports all agent roles with specialized functionality for each

### Agent-Focused Features

The server now includes comprehensive support for multiple agent roles and their specific workflows:

#### **ðŸŽ¯ Multi-Role Support**
- **Customer Service Agents**: Customer inquiries, order processing, support tickets
- **Business Agents**: Partnership management, sales operations, market analysis  
- **Product Owners**: Product management, feature development, pricing strategy
- **Research Analysts**: Data analysis, user behavior, performance metrics

#### **ðŸ”§ Role-Specific Tools**
- **Smart Categorization**: API methods automatically categorized for role-specific workflows
- **Agent Mode**: Enhanced filtering and workflow suggestions when `agent_mode=true`
- **Role Dashboards**: Specialized dashboards for each agent role with priority methods
- **Workflow Suggestions**: Automatic suggestions for common role-specific workflows
- **Contextual Descriptions**: Tool descriptions include role-specific context and usage guidance

#### **ðŸ“Š Role Categories**

**Customer Service Agent:**
- Customer: client, customer, account, contact operations
- Orders: order, invoice, billing, payment, product operations  
- Support: ticket, support, help, issue, request operations
- Business: domain, hosting, service, package, plan operations
- Management: admin, config, setting, manage, update operations
- Reports: report, stat, analytic, log, audit operations

**Business Agent:**
- Partnerships: partner, affiliate, reseller, vendor, supplier operations
- Sales: lead, prospect, sale, conversion, pipeline operations
- Market: campaign, promo, discount, marketing, segment operations
- Business: revenue, profit, cost, pricing, commission operations
- Analytics: report, stat, metric, performance, trend operations
- Strategy: plan, goal, target, forecast, budget operations

**Product Owner:**
- Products: product, package, plan, service, feature operations
- Development: config, setting, template, custom, build operations
- Roadmap: version, update, release, deploy, migration operations
- Analytics: usage, adoption, feedback, metric, performance operations
- Management: category, inventory, pricing, lifecycle, portfolio operations
- Integration: api, webhook, connector, sync, import operations

**Research Analyst:**
- Analytics: report, stat, analytic, metric, data operations
- Research: survey, feedback, review, rating, opinion operations
- Behavior: usage, activity, session, interaction, event operations
- Performance: performance, speed, load, response, benchmark operations
- Insights: trend, pattern, correlation, prediction, forecast operations
- Monitoring: log, audit, track, monitor, alert operations

### Fallback Tools

- **`hostbill_test_connection`**: Test API connectivity
- **`hostbill_server_info`**: Get HostBill server information

## Security Considerations

- API credentials are handled securely through environment variables
- Only methods permitted by the API key are exposed
- Input validation and error handling prevent malicious requests
- No sensitive data is logged or cached persistently

## Performance Features

- **Method Caching**: API method lists are cached for 5 minutes
- **Lazy Loading**: Method details are fetched only when needed
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses HTTP connections when possible
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to basic functionality if discovery fails
